# WhatsApp Bot

## Overview
A simple, pure Node.js WhatsApp bot that connects via WhatsApp Web using Baileys. The bot responds to basic commands and maintains a clean, minimal codebase without AI processing or complex features. It includes health monitoring and connection management for reliable operation.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Security: wa-auth directory should be in gitignore to protect authentication data
- Architecture: Pure Node.js implementation without Python or AI dependencies
- Health Checks: Expose port for health monitoring
- Commands: Implement .ping command for basic bot functionality

## System Architecture
### Core Architecture
Simple Node.js WhatsApp bot with minimal dependencies. The main application (`main.js`) handles WhatsApp Web connection, message processing, and basic command responses.

### Configuration
Environment variables manage WhatsApp credentials (WHATSAPP_CREDS) and server port (PORT).

### WhatsApp Integration
Uses Baileys library for WhatsApp Web connectivity with authentication state management and message handling.

### Command System
Enhanced command processor with reaction support:
- **.ping**: Returns bot status, uptime, and network speed with âš¡ reaction
- **.tag [message]**: Tags all group members silently with custom message and ðŸ‘¥ reaction
- Command reactions provide instant feedback to users
- Network speed measurement for performance monitoring
- Group member tagging with mention functionality

### Health Monitoring
HTTP server on port 8080 provides health check endpoint for deployment monitoring.

## External Dependencies
### WhatsApp Integration
- **baileys**: Official WhatsApp Web client library from GitHub (WhiskeySockets/Baileys)
- **@hapi/boom**: Error handling for Baileys
- **pino**: Logging library
- **qrcode-terminal**: QR code generation for initial setup

### Core Node.js Libraries
- **http**: Built-in HTTP server for health checks
- **fs**: File system operations for credential management
- **path**: Path utilities
