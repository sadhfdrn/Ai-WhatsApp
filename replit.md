# WhatsApp Bot

## Overview
A simple, pure Node.js WhatsApp bot that connects via WhatsApp Web using Baileys. The bot responds to basic commands and maintains a clean, minimal codebase without AI processing or complex features. It includes health monitoring and connection management for reliable operation.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Security: wa-auth directory should be in gitignore to protect authentication data
- Architecture: Pure Node.js implementation without Python or AI dependencies
- Health Checks: Expose port for health monitoring
- Commands: Implement .ping command for basic bot functionality

## System Architecture

Simple Node.js WhatsApp bot with minimal dependencies. The main application (`main.js`) handles WhatsApp Web connection, message processing, and basic command responses.

### Configuration
Environment variables manage WhatsApp credentials (WHATSAPP_CREDS), server port (PORT), customizable command prefix (PREFIX), and optional owner number for welcome messages (OWNER_NUMBER).

### WhatsApp Integration
Uses Baileys library for WhatsApp Web connectivity with authentication state management and message handling.

### Plugin System

- **Plugin Manager**: Automatic loading and management of command plugins
- **ping**: Returns bot status, uptime, and network speed with ‚ö° reaction
- **menu/help/commands**: Shows formatted bot menu with all available commands with üìã reaction
- **tag [message]**: Tags all group members silently with custom message and üë• reaction
- **tagall**: Tags all group members loudly without requiring a message and üîî reaction
