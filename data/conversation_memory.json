      "message": "1 Peter 2:1-9 NLT\r\n[1] So get rid of all evil behavior. Be done with all deceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, and all unkind speech. \n[2] Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment,\n[3] now that you have had a taste of the Lord’s kindness.\n[4] You are coming to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God’s temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honor. ",
